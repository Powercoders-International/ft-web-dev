Hello, my name is Susanne.

I will be your and Matt's teaching assistent for this focus track.

Aside from work, I like reading, writing, performing arts and talking about life all night long. I copied that from Matt because it is true for me as well.

Two of my favorite songs are [Styx - Renegade](https://youtu.be/ZXhuso4OTG4) and [Fettes Brot - An Tage wie diesen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbChSuSQIo4). I have a lot of very different favorite songs.
