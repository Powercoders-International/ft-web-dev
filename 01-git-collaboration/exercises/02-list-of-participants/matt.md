Hello, my name is Matt.

I will be your main IT trainer for this focus track.

I am passionate about programming languages and would like to create my own one day. I will start a a PhD at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/fr/) in September at the [LAMP](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lamp/) lab, where the [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) programming language was created. Previously, I worked at [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/labs/r/labs/home) on [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/), mainly on the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) implementation. I generally think that programming is too convoluted and could be made simpler.

Aside from work, I like reading, writing, performing arts and talking about life all night long. I would like to live in an ecovillage at some point.

My favorite songs are [Vitas - 7th Element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5-X_3_Kpww) and [Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
