## The GitHub workflow

See [Understanding the GitHub Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

1. Create a branch (see [Using branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)).
2. Open a PR (Pull Request) (see [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)).
3. Discuss and review your code
4. Merge the PR.

## GitHub issues

See [Mastering issues, GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

## GitHub Desktop App

[Try it](https://desktop.github.com/).

## <em class="type">Exercise 1</em> Your exercises repository

1. Create a new repository in your GitHub account with a Readme file. If you decide to make it private, please add [Susanne](https://github.com/sardaykin) and [I](https://github.com/mbovel/) as contributors (under "Settings" > "Manage access").
2. Create an issue named "Do first exercise" with the label "enhancement".
3. In a branch `git-exercise-1`, add a file named `01-git-collaboration/01-quote/index.html` showing the quote of your choice at the center of the page.
4. Once this is done, create a pull request for this branch, and add Susanne and I as reviewers.
5. After we approved the pull request, merge it.

## Forks

See [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

## <em class="type">Exercise 2</em> List of participants

Make a pull request to this repository to add a Markdown file `[your-name].md` to the folder `02-git-collaboration/exercises/02-list-of-participants` with a link to your favorite song and two lines about you if you would like to (note that this repo is public).
