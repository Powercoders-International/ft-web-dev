# Powercoders web development track, spring 2021

For an overview of the course, see the [journal](https://powercoders-switzerland.github.io/2021-1-web-dev/).

## How to build the slides

The following instructions are targeted to those wishing to _edit_ the slides.

Slides are compiled from `*/Readme.md` files to `*/slides.html` [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentations using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

If you have `pandoc` and `make` installed on your computer, your can directly run:

```
make
```

If you don't but you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, then you can use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```
docker-composer up
```
